## Project 1 : Parallel Box Blur Filter

* Intro : "In this assignment, we will implement a box blur filter, used in applications like Adobe® PhotoShop® to blur images."
* [Description](http://lara.epfl.ch/w/parcon18:project1)
* [Code](project1)

## Project 2 : Reductions and Prefix Sums

* Intro : "In this assignment, you will implement several variants of reduction and prefix sum algorithms."
* [Description](http://lara.epfl.ch/w/parcon18:project2)
* [Code](project2)

## Project 3 : K-Means

* Intro : "In this assignment, you will implement the K-means algorithm for cluster detection, which is used to partition n vectors into k clusters."
* [Description](http://lara.epfl.ch/w/parcon18:project3)
* [Code](project3)

## Project 4 : Barnes-Hut Simulation

* Intro : "In this assignment, you will implement the parallel Barnes-Hut algorithm for N-body simulation. N-body simulation is a simulation of a system of N particles that interact with physical forces, such as gravity or electrostatic force."
* [Description](http://lara.epfl.ch/w/parcon18:project4)
* [Code](project4)

## Project 5 : Concurrent Bounded Buffer

* Intro : "The goal of this assignment is to implement a fixed size buffer that can be accessed concurrently by multiple threads running in parallel."
* [Description](http://lara.epfl.ch/w/parcon18:project5)
* [Code](project5)

## Project 6 : Lock-free Sorted List

* Intro : "The goal of this assignment is to implement a concurrent list that stores values of type `Int` in ascending order."
* [Description](http://lara.epfl.ch/w/parcon18:project6)
* [Code](project6)

## Project 7 : Binary Trees

* Intro : "Your task in this assignment is to implement an actor-based binary tree set where each node is represented by one actor."
* [Description](http://lara.epfl.ch/w/parcon18:project7)
* [Code](project7)

# Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark

## Project 8 : Wikipedia

* Intro : "In this assignment, you will get to know Spark by exploring full-text Wikipedia articles."
* Note : The ressources folder has been deleted because of the size.
* [Description](http://lara.epfl.ch/w/parcon18:project8)
* [Code](project8)

## Project 9 : StackOverflow

* Intro : "The overall goal of this assignment is to implement a distributed k-means algorithm which clusters posts on the popular question-answer platform StackOverflow according to their score."
* Note : The ressources folder has been deleted because of the size.
* [Description](http://lara.epfl.ch/w/parcon18:project9)
* [Code](project9)
